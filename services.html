			<h3>How we help you</h3>
			<p>We help you by providing a creative alternative to traditional therapeutic tactics. Our services are great If your needs are not being met in a more traditional therapy environment. All therapy sessions consist of the patient, the therapist and the horse and together this combination can be very rewarding. Our therapists are EAGALA registered and certified and will manage your therapy session by directing the patient and the horse through a relaxing and therapeutic experience.  </p>

			<h3>How our therapy works</h3>
			<p>Our therapy works by connecting the patient and horse together and facilitating a bonding experience between them. This bond is crucial to ensuring the patient has a positive experience and is the first step to the therapy. Horses are extremely delicate creatures as far as social interactions go, they don’t beat around the bush at all. Horses will let you know how they are feeling and they are excellent at mirroring the energy and behavior of the rider.   </p>
			<p>We coach our patients to approach the horses with positivity and in return the horse will return that positivity and they will begin to bond. Once the bond has been established the real rewards of the therapy begin to show. The relaxing, socially engaging interactions with the horse help to control and heal from the struggles and traumas the patient might be suffering from. </p>

			<h3>Offered services</h3>
			<p> We provide services to people of all ages and we tailor our services to the induvial patient’s needs. We have five different horses each with different personalities, and each of them are better suited for working with different types of people suffering from different ailments.</p>
			<p> We have a special pony sized horse for small children to work with, she is very gentle. Our services are primarily focused on, but not limited to; helping people who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Varying degrees of Anxiety, Depression, Abuse, Sexual trauma, emotional struggles, and disabilities such as Autism, Down Syndrome and Anger issues.   </p>

			<h3>Our Specialties</h3>
			<p>The areas that we have the most experience in is helping people who have PTSD, experienced abuse or sexual trauma and those who suffer from Autism and Down syndrome.  We are particularly experienced in working with children. Children are less able to effectively express their thoughts and feelings than adults. Our organization has its roots in helping children of trauma, and we are able to help the child heal through interactions with the horse while helping them communicate their feelings effectively.  </p>

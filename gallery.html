							<h3>Peaches</h3>
							<p>This is Peaches, she is 13 years old and loves to eat peaches! Peaches has a very mellow personality and is perfectly suited to this line of work. She loves getting to take children for slow walks around the paddocks, especially when those children have peaches or apples for her. Erin has known Peaches for 5 years and it was just last year that Peaches came to work with us. After your session, feel free to enjoy eating some peaches, just makes sure to save one for Peaches! </p>

							<h3>Harmony</h3>
							<p>This is Harmony, she is 8 years old and has a fiery personality. Although she can be temperamental, its just with the other horses as she is the alpha in the herd. She is very sweet with people and has a soft spot for head rubs. Erin has been working with Harmony for 4 years. Come enjoy a harmonious ride with Harmony! </p>

							<img  class="torchlight" src="images/cruz.jpg" title="Cruz the horse" alt="Cruz the horse" style= "width:300px;">
							<h3>Cruz</h3>
							<p>This is Cruz, he is a 14-year-old male horse. He is our second smallest in size and very soft tempered. He is the perfect mix of relaxing with a touch of playfulness. His favorite foods are apples and carrots, although he enjoys the occasional banana. If youâ€™re nervous about being around horses he is a good choice to break the ice and take you on an easy cruise, with Cruz.</p>

							<img  class="torchlight" src="images/bleu.jpg" title="Bleu the horse" alt="Bleu the horse" style="width:300px;">
							<h3>Bleu</h3>
							<p>This is Bleu, he is 10 years old and the joker of the bunch. His name is a homage to his incredibly blue eyes. He is goofy, and light hearted and likes to guide you around where he wants to go. An excellent choice for anyone looking to spend some time with a very personable horse. Come ride under Blue skies with Bleu! </p>

							<div>
							<img  class="torchlight" src="images/ember.jpg" title="Ember the pony" alt="Ember the pony" style="width:300px;">
							<h3>Ember</h3>
							<p>This is Ember, she is 14 years old and our smallest horse, weighing in at pony size. She is exceptionally sweet and absolutely loves human interaction. She is perfect for helping the children as her small size makes it difficulty for her to help adults, unless they just want to pet and feed her. Ignite the spark of healing with Ember. </p>

			<h3>Our Introduction</h3>
			<p>Healing Horses of Charleston is dedicated to helping people with a wide degree of mental and emotional disabilities, by enriching their lives through the magical act of bonding with a horse. </p>

			<p>Riding with a horse can be very therapeutic and calming to those who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, forms of Anxiety, Depression and a number of other conditions. Aside from the act of riding and bonding with a horse being calming, it is also very fun and serves to aid in social skills with a non-judgmental partner (horse). </p>

			<p>Healing Horses of Charleston is LEAP (Lowcountry Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy) certified as well as an active member of CATR (Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding). We are a small and private center with five active duty horses located on beautiful Wadmalaw Island. </p>

			<p>All of our horses are professionally trained to work with both children and adults and exhibit extreme sensitivity and respect for clients. When you couple these horses with our amazing staff, that's when the magic happens.</p>

			<h3>The Mission</h3>
			<p>Mission Statement: Our mission here at Healing Horses of Charleston is to help the folks of the Lowcountry who are in need of mental or emotional therapy by combining highly experienced therapists and our beautiful horses into a one of a kind therapeutic experience. </p>
			<p>We serve to help all kinds regardless of age, race, gender, color, creed or economic status. Our purpose is to improve your mental health and quality of life using our expertly honed techniques and clinically driven program.  </p>

			<h3>Story Origination</h3>
			<p>Our organization began in 2018 when Erin Bisca finally was able to make her dreams come true of combining her two passions; Helping people and being around animals. Erin has always been fond of all animals, especially horses.  </p>

			<p> After obtaining her degree in Biology from College of Charleston Erin went on to get her masters in Clinical Counseling from The Citadel. Since then she has volunteered, interned and worked at numerous Mental Health Agencies in the Charleston Area. She worked for Dorchester Children’s Advocacy Center for 3 years and has now moved into her own practice at Healing Horses of Charleston.  </p>

			<p>Erin and her husband Tommy Bisca live on the grounds of their six-acre Wadmalaw island ranch where they care for their 5 horses, 2 dogs, 6 cats, 2 ferrets, pig, turtle, rabbit and hamster. </p>

			<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>Our primary goals here at Healing Horses of Charleston is to help heal those in need by combining highly experienced therapists and our beautiful horses into a one of a kind therapeutic experience. The horses are there to bond with the patients and provide deep connections for the patients to enjoy and cherish.  . </p>
			<p>These connections have had great success at helping people who suffer from emotional, behavioral, or psychological hardships. Our main aim is to help improve the lives of those of those who come to us in need and our horses are our chosen method of doing so.   </p>

					<p>Erin Bisca has always had a fierce love of animals and growing up with her sister who suffers from Down Syndrome, Erin has also had a fierce love of helping those in need. After years of school, training and work experience she has finally achieved her dream of being able to help people using animals as her primary method. Erin graduated from College of Charleston with a degree in Biology where she met her husband Tommy Bisca. After graduating from College of Charleston, Erin attended The Citadel where she graduated with her master’s degree in Clinical Counseling. </p>
					<p>Erin did three internships, one with MUSC pediatrics department, another with Charleston Mental Health Center and a third with Dorchester Children Advocacy Center. After her internships she started working with Dorchester Children’s Advocacy Center as a Forensic Interviewer and therapeutic counselor. She worked there for three years before taking the big step to enter into her own practice by founding Healing Horses of Charleston. </p>

					<p>Tommy Bisca is Erin’s husband and has always been fond of helping her with and sharing her dreams. Tommy graduated from College of Charleston with a degree and Biology and then went on to study computer programming at Trident Technical College. Although Tommy isn’t trained in the clinical counseling discipline, he helps by taking care of all the horses, other animals and the riding grounds. </p>
					<p>Tommy has always been around animals from a young age as his father was a wild life rescue ranger and there were constantly all sorts of animals coming in and out of Tommy’s life. Tommy learned how to care for and bond with almost any animal and those skills serve him well here. Meeting Erin was the happiest day of his life, as he finally found someone who shared his passion for animals. </p>

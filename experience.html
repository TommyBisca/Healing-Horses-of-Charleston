			<h3>The Experience</h3>
			<p>The peaceful serenity of our location out on Wadmalaw is part of our success. Being out in the woods but still close enough to smell the salt of the ocean can be very soothing to most people. Our sessions are anywhere from 1 to 3 hours long depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the issues they are struggling with.   </p>

			<p> On the first day all new patients begin with a traditional therapy assessment session so that we can fully understand what they are going through, after which we do a “meet and greet” with the horses where patients can meet and interact with them to get to know them. Using the information garnered in the first session allows us to create an individually tailored approach to each patient, as each patient is unique and has their own needs.   </p>

			<p>Your interactions with our horses during the meet and greet also influence what horse we decide to pair you with, although you can always request any horse you would like. Every riding session begins with a short traditional therapy session to discuss what we want to accomplish today as a patient therapist team, and every riding session ends with a traditional therapy session to discuss our progress and how the patient is feeling about their issues and whether anything new has come up.   </p>

			<p>Once we get into the primary sessions we begin with learning how to approach the horse with positivity, how to speak to the horse, and how to appropriately touch and pet the horse. We also do breathing exercises with the horses, learning how to calm ourselves to match the horses’ level of calmness. Once everyone is comfortable with each other, we will begin riding lessons teaching the patients how to mount and give the horse commands to trot around fields. We nurture their growing level of horsemanship until they can ride the horse around the field unassisted. It is through all these activities and more that we can facilitate healing in those who need it. </p>

			<h3>Individually Tailored Therapy</h3>
			<p>Although all of therapy focuses around helping patients through bonding with horses, we do still tailor every session to the specific needs of the patient. We have different horses who have different personalities to help every type of patient we see. If the patient is a child with a short attention span we may start our sessions off at one hour so as not to wear them out, versus an adult who might benefit from an extended three-hour long session. </p>
			<p> If our patient is physically disabled and cannot ride on the horse, we do still offer our services, it really doesn’t change much about the experience. We are still focused on developing that bond between horse and human and this does not require one to ride. No matter what struggles our patients have, we tailor every therapy session to fit the individual needs of the patient.  </p>

			<h3>Success Stories</h3>
			<p>Erin’s first ever patient was her husband Tommy. After Tommy’s father passed away he sunk into a heavy depression that was only exacerbated by 3 of his grandparents passing away shortly after his father. All this close familial loss in such a short time was sending Tommy in a downward spiral of grief and despair. </p>
			<p>Erin began treating him for depression back in 2017 and with the aid of the horses and the unique bonds Tommy formed with them, he was able to rise back up out of that depression and accept that passing of his loved ones. Although he still mourns for his family, whenever Tommy is feeling down he always come out to the horses and spends some time with them, their bond is ever as strong. Tommy: “I couldn’t have gotten through that tough time of my life without the horses, they really helped to take my mind off the bad and show me some of the good and beautiful things of this world.”</p>
